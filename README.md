<b>Overlay</b> (top half of window): Select a button you wish to remap by clicking on it. Click again to deselect it. Change the icon by choosing one from the list next to the button. If you wish, you can manage layers in the middle of the screen.

<b>Keyboard</b> (bottom half of window): After you selected an overlay button, click on a keyboard key. It will change color, showing you which button you assigned it to. To remove the connection, select the same button-key combination again.

<b>Warning</b>: This program generates a specific overlay that requires certain PNG files in order to work. Also, if you modify button positions manually or anything like that, the program might not be able to load it anymore.
